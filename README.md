# minitwit
Jennifer Jones and Bryan Duplantis are working on the Login Feature that uses passport-twitter module to authenticate and login users to an awesome new app cohort 9 has created as a group project!

Using Passport-Twitter node module, we will be working with the following parameters:
  Strategies: authenticate requests

  Config/Auth.js file: houses consumer Key Secret and Callback URL so that our app knows the secrets it needs to authenticate with Twitter

  Config/passport.js file: configure passport's twitter strategy
